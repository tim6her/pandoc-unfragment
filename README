# pandoc-unfragment
A simple pandoc-filter for writing beamer presentations alongside reveal.js
---

Writing *pandoc* projects with `beamer` and `revealjs` as output formats. One sometimes runs into the problem that *pandoc* does not know where a block should start and end. This is especially important for pauses or fragments `. . .`. Enclosing the block in a `<div>` solves the problem for `revealjs` but breaks `beamer`. That's why I created this simple *pandoc* filter, unwrapping blocks that a handeled fine by *LaTeX*.

## Example

    ## Periodic Groups
    
    ### Definition
    
    A group $G$ is called *periodic* if for each element $a \in G$ there exists an integer $n > 0$ such that
    $$a^n = e.$$
    
    . . .
    
    <div fragment="true">
    ### Examples
    
     * Every finite group is periodic.
     * The direct product of cyclic groups
       $$ \bigoplus_{i=2}^\infty \Z_i $$
       is periodic.
    </div>

produces valid output using `revealjs` and gets transformed to

for usage with `beamer`.
